# iMacColorUnlocker
Access to the iMac custom colors in macOS 

This tool allows you to gain access to the custom accent colors present in the new M1 iMacs without having an M1 iMac. 

This requries macOS 12 or later 

This program uses UserDefaults and controls 2 global properties `NSColorSimulatedHardwareEnclosureNumber` and `NSColorSimulateHardwareAccent`. You will need to restart any open apps in order for the accent color to take. You may also have to go into System Preferences and choose the accent color once you enable and select it.
